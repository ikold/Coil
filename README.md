# Coil Engine
Base on the Game Engine series by the Cherno ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw)) and his Hazel Engine ([GitHub](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel)) under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/blob/master/LICENSE).

The purpose of the Coil Engine is to be a Breakable Toy, allowing me to learn about game engines and improve my C++ skills.
Most of the code closely follows the Game Engine series for future compatibility purposes (especially rendering). However, to further increase learning potential, I try to personalize the source code and implement my own solutions.
I have implemented my own: String libraries, Logging, GUI interface, low overhead Profiling (improved version of the one in the series), Time library, and Doxygen comments.
